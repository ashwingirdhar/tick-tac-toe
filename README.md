# tick-tack-toe

Tic-tac-toe is a game where two players X and O fill the hash (#) shaped box (consist of two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines) with their alternate turns. The player who first fills the box with 3Xs or 3Os in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal manner will win the game.

Here I have used random generator for computer to choose the position .
